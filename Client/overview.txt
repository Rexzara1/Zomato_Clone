    Lifecycle of REACT JS: 3 phase
        1. Mounting Phaase: Initail mount to the Document
                > Contructors
                > Render
                > ComponentDidMount - Calling of the APIs to bind the data

        2. Updating Phase: User Interaction
                > Render

    THings to check while converting HTML page to REACT:
        -> Comments in HTML <!-- --> needs to be changed by {/* */}
        -> In react all tags must be closed. (in case of self closing tags must be closed like -> <img/> )
        -> In react inline style needs to be writen inside {{ }}
        -> In HTML class needs to be replaced by className.
        -> In react all variables are written inside " " - double quote.
